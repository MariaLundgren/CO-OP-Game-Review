## Strategy

The purpose of this website is to create a community-based review site for co-op videogames where people can share their experiences and thoughts on videogames that they have played. The target audience is people who want help with deciding what the next co-op game they should to play or just are interested in sharing and reading others reviews of co-op games. 

## Scope

Site owners’ goal: To create a community where people who have a common interest for playing co-op videogames can share reviews and experiences playing different games with each other. In the future the site owner could also be making money on the site if it becomes big enough that they can advertise games on the site and have add-links to places where you can purchase the videogames.
